## Setup and Run Instructions

This will guide you through the process of setting up a Mamba environment and running the provided Python code to see it in action. It uses the last known working versions of Python and packages used.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your system. Mamba is a fast, cross-platform package manager.

### Steps

1. **Create a Mamba Environment**
   
   Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

   ```shell
   mamba create -n [ENVIRONMENT_NAME] python=3.9.19 -y
   mamba activate [ENVIRONMENT_NAME]
   ```

2. **Install Necessary Packages**

    ```shell
    # Install each with mamba and fall back to pip if necessary
    for pkg in graphviz=0.20.1, readme_ation=0.1.13, yaml=6.0.1; do (mamba install $pkg -y || pip install "${pkg//=/==}"); done
    ```

3. **Run the Script**

    Ensure you are in your project directory and run:

    ```shell
    python [FILE_NAME]
    ```

    Or click 'run' in your IDE of choice.
