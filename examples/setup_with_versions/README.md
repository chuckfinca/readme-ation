This will guide you through the process of setting up a Mamba environment and running the provided Python code to see it in action. It uses the last known working versions of Python and packages used.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your system. Mamba is a fast, cross-platform package manager.

### Steps

1. **Create a Mamba Environment**
   
   Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   mamba create -n myenv python=3.9.19 -y
   mamba activate myenv

2. **Install Necessary Packages**

    ```bash
    # Install each with mamba and fall back to pip if necessary
    for pkg in graphviz=2.50.0, matplotlib=3.8.4, numpy=1.26.4, readme_ation=0.1.11, torch=1.13.1, yaml=0.2.5; do mamba install $pkg -y || pip install $pkg; done

3. **Run the Script**

    Ensure you are in your project directory and run the file you added the readme-ation code to and run:

    ```bash
    python [FILE_NAME]

    Or click 'run' in your IDE of choice.
